## The Goal

The goal was to create an application with the ability of browsing and watching short movies shared by https://thebetter.bsgroup.eu API. The application allows you to enter as an anonymous or logged in user, depending on what kind of user are you, you will see a bit different content - anonymous should see only trial versions of movies wherase logged user should see 'normaln; movie

## Future plans

Current API for registered users shares refresh token, in current implemmentation after expiring token, the token is deleted and user is forced to log in again, in the future it could be replaced with refreshing expiring token using "refresh token" until the moment when user logs off himself/herself.  


## `npm start`
